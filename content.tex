% PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE %
\section{PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Back End Developer, Rahnema College, Tehran, Iran (Fall 2017)} 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Internship, Developing INJA App (A social network application like Swarm) using Spring Framework, MySQL, MongoDB for Back End
				
				\item INJA App is an application (both an andriod application and a web-based application) which users can register and share their location with their friends. For every post you can upload images, put comments, like the post and reply to other user's comments. 
			\item We were 7 people in the project (2 people for Front End, 2 for Android and 3 for Back End). Our Back End team was responsible for implementing a server-side application using Spring Framework and a database for storing information of users; for example username and passwords in a SQL database (MySQL) and comments, posts in a NoSQL database (MongoDB).  
			\item I have worked with Spring Framework (Java), CentOS (through SSH), Jira (Scrum), Git (Local GitLab) in Rahnema College; also I have learned some basic queries for MongoDB and MySQL.
		\end{itemize}
			\vspace{+1 em}
		\item \textbf{Front End Developer and Hardware Engineer, IoT Academy, Tehran, Iran (Summer and Fall 2018)} 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Internship, Implementing a smart garden using Raspberry Pi, Arduino (Hardware), HTML, CSS, Javascript (Front End), Android
			\item The Smart Garden project includes 18 flower pots which our team was responsible for protecting. 
			\item Actually, we measured temperature, humidity, soil moisture, smoke (ppm), the water level in the tank, humidity of the floor and light intensity in the garden; we monitored them in both an Android application and a Web-based dashboard.
			\item We controlled the actuators (water pumps, fogger, lights, water tap) based on the values which we measured with our sensors. For Back End, we used Thing talk platform which is a fork of Thingspeak platform for IoT Back End.
\item I was responsible for programming Raspberry Pi as our IoT gateway using Python and Zigbee module. Also, I contributed in Front End team; we used pure HTML, CSS, JavaScript for developing a dashboard which monitored real-time values of sensors and had charts for presenting a history of sensors values and actuators statuses.

		\begin{itemize}
			\item A computer game, written in C++ (Qt) with audio control using speech recognition with Python and Tensorflow, Advanced Programming course project, Dr. Jahanshahi
\item Infact, you can control the Pac-Man game by just pronouncing "up", "down", "left", "stop", "start" and "go". You can play the game in both Windows OS and Linux OS.
We used Tensorflow and Google Dataset for training our network. 
\item Also, the game itself was a fork of a repository in GitHub which we had to rewrite most of it and improve the graphical view of the game.
